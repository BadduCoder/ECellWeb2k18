                    B-model is indeed of great importance because along with giving clarity for business, it provides the budding entrepreneurs
                    the required details about a business including the target audience, competitors and scope in the future.
                    Also the B-model contains the relevant information that is required by the investor. The primary motive
                    for implementing this competition in our college is solely intended to set alight the entrepreneurial
                    spirits among the students so as to educate and inspire smarter entrepreneurs who want to launch ventures
                    that are more successful.
